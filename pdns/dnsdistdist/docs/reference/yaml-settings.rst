YAML configuration reference
============================

Since 2.0.0, :program:`dnsdist` supports the YAML configuration format in addition to the existing Lua one.

If the configuration file passed to :program:`dnsdist` via the ``-C`` command-line switch ends in ``.yml``, it is assumed to be in the new YAML format, and an attempt to load a Lua configuration file with the same name but the ``.lua`` will be done before loading the YAML configuration. If the names ends in ``.lua``, there will also be an attempt to find a file with the same name but ending in ``.yml``. Otherwise the existing Lua configuration format is assumed.

A YAML configuration file contains several sections, that are described below.

.. _yaml-settings-BackendConfiguration:

BackendConfiguration
--------------------

Generic settings for backends

- **address**: String - ``ip``:``port`` of the backend server (if unset, port defaults to 53 for Do53 backends, 853 for DoT and DoQ, and 443 for DoH and DoH3 ones
- **id**: String ``("")`` - Use a pre-defined UUID instead of a random one
- **name**: String ``("")`` - The name associated to this backend, for display purpose
- **protocol**: String - The DNS protocol to use to contact this backend. Supported values are: Do53, DoT, DoH
- **tls**: :ref:`OutgoingTlsConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingTlsConfiguration>` - TLS-related settings for DoT and DoH backends
- **doh**: :ref:`OutgoingDohConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingDohConfiguration>` - DoH-related settings for DoH backends
- **use_client_subnet**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Whether to add (or override, see :ref:`_yaml-settings-Edns_client_subnetConfiguration`) an EDNS Client Subnet to the DNS payload before forwarding it to the backend. Please see :doc:`../advanced/passing-source-address` for more information
- **use_proxy_protocol**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Add a proxy protocol header to the query, passing along the client's IP address and port along with the original destination address and port
- **queries_per_second**: Unsigned integer ``(0)`` - Limit the number of queries per second to ``number``, when using the ``firstAvailable`` policy
- **order**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - The order of this server, used by the `leastOutstanding` and `firstAvailable` policies
- **weight**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - The weight of this server, used by the `wrandom`, `whashed` and `chashed` policies, default: 1. Supported values are a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 2147483647
- **pools**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - List of pools to place this backend into. By default a server is placed in the default ("") pool
- **tcp**: :ref:`OutgoingTcpConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingTcpConfiguration>` - TCP-related settings for a backend
- **ip_bind_addr_no_port**: Boolean ``(true)`` - Whether to enable ``IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT`` if available
- **health_checks**: :ref:`HealthCheckConfiguration <yaml-settings-HealthCheckConfiguration>` - Health-check settings
- **source**: String ``("")`` - The source address or interface to use for queries to this backend, by default this is left to the kernel's address selection.
The following formats are supported:

 - address, e.g. ``""192.0.2.2""``
 - interface name, e.g. ``""eth0""``
 - address@interface, e.g. ``""192.0.2.2@eth0""``

- **sockets**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - Number of UDP sockets (and thus source ports) used toward the backend server, defaults to a single one. Note that for backends which are multithreaded, this setting will have an effect on the number of cores that will be used to process traffic from dnsdist. For example you may want to set ``sockets`` to a number somewhat greater than the number of worker threads configured in the backend, particularly if the Linux kernel is being used to distribute traffic to multiple threads listening on the same socket (via ``reuseport``). See also ``randomize_outgoing_sockets_to_backend`` in :ref:`_yaml-settings-Udp_tuningConfiguration`
- **disable_zero_scope**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Disable the EDNS Client Subnet :doc:`../advanced/zero-scope` feature, which does a cache lookup for an answer valid for all subnets (ECS scope of 0) before adding ECS information to the query and doing the regular lookup. Default is false. This requires the ``parse_ecs`` option of the corresponding cache to be set to true
- **reconnect_on_up**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Close and reopen the sockets when a server transits from Down to Up. This helps when an interface is missing when dnsdist is started
- **max_in_flight**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - Maximum number of in-flight queries. The default is 0, which disables out-of-order processing. It should only be enabled if the backend does support out-of-order processing. Out-of-order processing needs to be enabled on the frontend as well
- **tcp_only**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Always forward queries to that backend over TCP, never over UDP. Always enabled for TLS backends
- **auto_upgrade**: :ref:`OutgoingAutoUpgradeConfiguration <yaml-settings-OutgoingAutoUpgradeConfiguration>` - Auto-upgrade related settings
- **max_concurrent_tcp_connections**: Unsigned integer ``(0)`` - Maximum number of TCP connections to that backend. When that limit is reached, queries routed to that backend that cannot be forwarded over an existing connection will be dropped. Default is 0 which means no limit
- **proxy_protocol_advertise_tls**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Whether to set the SSL Proxy Protocol TLV in the proxy protocol payload sent to the backend if the query was received over an encrypted channel (DNSCrypt, DoQ, DoH or DoT). Requires ``use_proxy_protocol``
- **mac_address**: String ``("")`` - When the ``xsk`` option is set, this parameter can be used to specify the destination MAC address to use to reach the backend. If this options is not specified, dnsdist will try to get it from the IP of the backend by looking into the system's MAC address table, but it will fail if the corresponding MAC address is not present
- **cpus**: String ``("")`` - Set the CPU affinity for this thread, asking the scheduler to run it on a single CPU id, or a set of CPU ids. This parameter is only available if the OS provides the ``pthread_setaffinity_np()`` function
- **xsk**: String ``("")`` - The name of an XSK sockets map to attach to this frontend, if any


.. _yaml-settings-BindConfiguration:

BindConfiguration
-----------------

General settings for frontends

- **listen_address**: String - Address and port to listen to
- **reuseport**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Set the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` socket option, allowing several sockets to be listening on this address and port

- **threads**: Unsigned integer ``(1)`` - Number of listening threads to create for this frontend
- **interface**: String ``("")`` - Set the network interface to use
- **cpus**: String ``("")`` - Set the CPU affinity for this listener thread, asking the scheduler to run it on a single CPU id, or a set of CPU ids. This parameter is only available if the OS provides the ``pthread_setaffinity_np()`` function
- **enable_proxy_protocol**: Boolean ``(false)`` - Whether to expect a proxy protocol v2 header in front of incoming queries coming from an address allowed by the ACL in :ref:`_yaml-settings-Proxy_protocolConfiguration`. Default is ``true``, meaning that queries are expected to have a proxy protocol payload if they come from an address present in the proxy protocol ACL
- **tcp**: :ref:`IncomingTcpConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingTcpConfiguration>` - TCP-specific settings
- **tls**: :ref:`IncomingTlsConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingTlsConfiguration>` - TLS-specific settings
- **doh**: :ref:`IncomingDohConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingDohConfiguration>` - DNS over HTTPS-specific settings
- **doq**: :ref:`IncomingDoqConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingDoqConfiguration>` - DNS over QUIC-specific settings
- **quic**: :ref:`IncomingQuicConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingQuicConfiguration>` - QUIC-specific settings
- **dnscrypt**: :ref:`IncomingDnscryptConfiguration <yaml-settings-IncomingDnscryptConfiguration>` - DNSCrypt-specific settings
- **additional_addresses**: Sequence of String ``("")`` - List of additional addresses (with port) to listen on. Using this option instead of creating a new frontend for each address avoids the creation of new thread and Frontend objects, reducing the memory usage. The drawback is that there will be a single set of metrics for all addresses

--------------------

An ``eBPF`` map that is used to share data with kernel-land ``AF_XDP``/``XSK``, ``socket filter`` or ``XDP`` programs. Maps can be pinned to a filesystem path, which makes their content persistent across restarts and allows external programs to read their content and to add new entries. :program:`dnsdist` will try to load maps that are pinned to a filesystem path on startups, inheriting any existing entries, and fall back to creating them if they do not exist yet. Note that the user :program`dnsdist` is running under must have the right privileges to read and write to the given file, and to go through all the directories in the path leading to that file. The pinned path must be on a filesystem of type ``BPF``, usually below ``/sys/fs/bpf/``

- **max_entries**: Unsigned integer ``(0)`` - Maximum number of entries in this map. 0 means no entry at all
